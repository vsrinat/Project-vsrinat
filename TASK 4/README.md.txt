OLAP Operations on Sales Data (MySQL)

Overview:
This project performs OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) operations on sales data using MySQL. It demonstrates slicing, dicing, rollups, drilldowns, and cube simulations.

Key Features:
- Create and populate `sales_sample` table
- Perform OLAP operations:
  - Drill Down (Region → Product)
  - Rollup with subtotals
  - Simulated Cube (multi-dimensional analysis)
  - Slice (filter by region)
  - Dice (multi-condition filter)

Files:
- `sales_olap.sql` – contains all OLAP queries
- `screenshots/` – includes query result screenshots
- `README.md` – project description
